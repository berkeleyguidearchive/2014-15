<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span>The faculty associated with the Graduate Group in Endocrinology leading to the MAÂ and the PhD degrees have diverse interests representing endocrinology in the broadest sense: chemical mediators in the living world directed by autocrine, paracrine, endocrine and ectohormonal factors. The main goal of the program is to engage students in the interdisciplinary aspects of the field of Endocrinology through seminars, courses and diverse faculty research perspectives that range from structural, molecular and cellular endocrinology through organismal and comparative endocrinology to chemical ecology. Faculty encompasses hormone-oriented research programs such as cancer biology, signal transduction, drug design, membrane biology, virology, metabolism, differentiation, morphogenesis, toxicology and gene transcription. Graduates from the Endocrinology program have transitioned into careers in a variety of fields including education, research in both academic and industry settings, government regulation, and private business.</span></p>
