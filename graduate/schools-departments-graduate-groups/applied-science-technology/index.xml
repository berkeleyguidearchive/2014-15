<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Graduate Group is administered by the College of Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering Department. The program has three major areas of emphasis: applied physics, engineering science, and mathematical sciences. Faculty associated with the program are drawn from several departments within the College of Engineering as well as from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Statistics, and Mathematics. Topics of interest include the novel properties and applications of nanostructures, thin films and interface science, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), short wavelength coherent radiation, X-ray micro-imaging for the life and physical sciences, plasma physics and plasma-assisted materials processing, laser-induced chemical processes, laser probing of complex reacting systems, ultrafast phenomena, particle accelerators, nonlinear dynamics, chaotic systems, numerical methods, and topics in computational fluid mechanics and reacting flows. The Applied Science and Technology (AS&amp;T) program awards the Doctor of Philosophy degree.</p>
<p>Graduate research in the AS&amp;T Program benefits from state-of-the-art experimental facilities at the Berkeley campus and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Among these facilities are the National Center for Electron Microscopy, with the world's highest resolution high-voltage microscope; a microfabrication lab for student work involving lithography, MEMS ion-implantation, and thin-film deposition; an integrated sensors laboratory; femtosecond laser laboratories; optical, electrical, and magnetic resonance spectroscopies; short wavelength laser and X-ray research laboratories; an unparalleled variety of material, chemical, and surface science analytic equipment; and a soft X-ray synchrotron dedicated to materials, chemical, and biological research using high-brightness and partially coherent X-rays. The interdisciplinary, collaborative nature of the AS&amp;T Program provides ample opportunity to develop new research directions by making the best use possible of these facilities and of the other research instrumentation available to AS&amp;T faculty.</p>
<p>Students admitted to AS&amp;T have an opportunity to choose a research advisor from a diverse group of world-renowned faculty members engaged in cutting-edge research at the University of California, Berkeley.  Among more than 80 associated AS&amp;T faculty, students will find internationally-recognized faculty who have achieved great distinction in their scholarship.  All have published in top-tier archival journals, and most have been recognized by their peers as recipients of numerous awards, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and many more.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow">This course will explore modern developments in the physics and applications of soft x-rays. It begins with a review of electromagnetic radiation at short wavelengths including dipole radiation, scattering and refractive index, using a semi-classical atomic model. Subject matter will include the generation of x-rays with laboratory tubes, synchrotron radiation, laser-plasma sources, x-ray lasers, and black body radiation. Concepts of spatial and temporal coherence will be discussed.
