<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The PhD Program in Health Services and Policy Analysis is distinguished by its unique approach to interdisciplinary training in social sciences and its emphasis on real-world health policy issues. The program is a full time, four-to-five year curriculum of study that prepares students for careers in academia and research. Students purse a disciplinary focus in health economics, organizations, health politics/policy, or population health and acquire breadth through additional coursework taken in several departments and schools across campus in each of those fields. Students receive a PhD degree from the Graduate Division of the UC Berkeley campus. The group is within the academic jurisdiction of the Graduate Council and is administratively located in the School of Public Health. The Faculty Group is comprised of 24 professors drawn from the Economics, Political Science, and Demography departments, Haas School of Business, and Goldman School of Public Policy. <span>The group integrates and applies disciplinary knowledge from the social sciences to the health care system. Students receive a thorough grounding in research methods and the application of these methods to the analysis of health policy issues. </span></p>
