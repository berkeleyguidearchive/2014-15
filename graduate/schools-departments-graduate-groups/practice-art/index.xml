<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="column column-number-1 column-span-1">
<p>UC Berkeley’s Department of Art Practice provides professional art training within the context of a world-renowned public research university. The Department offers innovative, interdisciplinary courses leading to BA and MFA degrees. As practicing visual artists, the faculty of the Department of Art Practice hold as a principal goal the representation and analysis of human experiences through creative research in visual art. In making art, faculty seek to expand the boundaries of cultures and the limits of perceptions <span>through rigorous experimentation with art forms, media, and content. Considering human experiences from an experiential standpoint, experimentation leads to questioning beliefs, rituals, and philosophies as well as social, economic, and institutional structures. In teaching, the mission is to help students pose profound questions by developing their creative voices, mastering their practices, relating to their audiences, and connecting to histories of art and cultures.</span></p>
<p>Four goals underlie the teaching in the Department of Art:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To advance the body of knowledge of human experience through aesthetic investigation.</li>
	<li>To help students learn to think visually.</li>
	<li>To help students understand the strategies that artists have devised to deal with aesthetic problems in both traditional and nontraditional methods of art-making.</li>
	<li>To help students develop a creative intelligence through practicing a visual arts discipline.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Facilities and Resources</h3>
<p>The Department of Art Practice facilities include six studio spaces: <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/printmaking-labs/" target="_blank">Printmaking Studio</a>

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">This class provides a basic foundation for digital photography with hands-on instruction in the use of digital cameras and online image dissemination. Topics include image capture, composition, image syntax, image analysis, image manipulation, metatext production, and image sequencing for visual narratives. We also study image dissemination through online networks including social networks, blogs, news, storage, search, and print services. Rather than limiting the discussion of photography to the</span><span class="deschide"> production of the photographic image itself, we explore in written assignments how the reception of images can change based on context, usage, and network dynamics. While we rely on required DSLR digital cameras to produce images for weekly photographic assignments, we also experiment with alternate digital image generation techniques from telescopes to microscopes. All coursework will be posted and discussed online as well as in weekly lectures, workshops, and critiques. Course readings cover the history of photography, the theory of photographic reproduction and the theory of networked and memetic dissemination.

The argument threading through the course</span><span class="deschide"> will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">In this hands-on, project-based class, students will experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theatre, design, and art practice. They will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular</span><span class="deschide"> innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.
