<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science has long been one of the world's finest. The Department prides itself on its deep commitment to intellectual excellence and supporting inquiry and teaching that combines rigor, relevance, and openness to a variety of methodological and analytical approaches. The size of the faculty, currently 52, allows it to do justice to the study of a vast range of important issues in political life. The Department offers an unusual combination of depth and breadth in the major subject areas of political science, covering not only the traditional subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory but supplementing those subfields with very substantial strength in areas such as formal theory, methods, organizations and public policy, political behavior, and public law as well as the politics of every major region on the globe. Reflecting the Department's broad understanding of the subject matter and enduring commitment to interdisciplinary inquiry, many members of the Department have joint appointments in other schools (including business, information, law, and public policy) or departments (including economics and sociology) as well as strong connections to a variety of research centers around campus.</p>
<p>Each year, the Department serves approximately 1,000 declared and intended undergraduate majors and graduates approximately 400 students with a BA degree. Outstanding undergraduate education is central to its mission. To reflect commitment to undergraduates, there have been several major innovations in recent years, including a new set of requirements for graduation, a substantially enhanced Honors program, and a new seminar program to increase opportunities for undergraduates to work with faculty in small groups.</p>
<p>The Department has an outstanding Doctoral program, designed to prepare students for careers in university teaching and to conduct advanced research. Approximately 25 students enter the program each year and roughly 150 are enrolled at any given time. Graduate students take courses that offer state-of-the-art training in the conduct of research, combined with a very wide-ranging curriculum addressing fundamental issues in politics. The Department also seeks to integrate them rapidly into an intellectual community that prizes scholarly development through the exchange of ideas and the sharing of work in progress. After completing their work here, many will go on to take jobs at the country's leading colleges and universities.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">Antebellum American political history generally follows a routine script in which the purpose of the Revolution was to liberate Americans for self-government and economic and social development. Slavery is viewed as an anomaly still needing explanation, and Native American relocation as the consequence of natural forces of immigration and pre-modern social values. In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British</span><span class="deschide"> crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in the 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.

This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical</span><span class="deschide"> commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments. This course has a required discussion section.

<div class="coursebody">

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">The European Union is the world's most advanced experiment in governance beyond the level of the traditional nation-state. Through the European Union, the main members countries have pooled their national sovereignty and created new ways political authority, economic competition, social cohesion, and cultural identity. While specialists in comparative politics focus on the separate countries, scholars in international relations emphasize the construction of supranational institutions and transnational</span><span class="deschide"> identities. This course seeks to synthesize the comparative and international approaches by examining the economic, political, and cultural aspects of integration. Readings are drawn from international relations, comparative politics, public policy, sociology, and some anthropological debates. Course requirements include careful preparation of the readings, discussion sections, participation in a group report on one of the major domains mentioned above, and a closed-book final.

What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations.

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of ethnic politics.

Readings for each topic are drawn from various political science subfields as well as from other disciplines.
