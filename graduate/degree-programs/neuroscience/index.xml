<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Uniform minimum requirements for admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A minimum grade-point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g. Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, 230 on the computer-based test, 90 on the iBT test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Enough undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants who already hold a graduate degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees as evidence of broad research training, not as vocational training certificates; therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to take up new subject matter on a serious level without undertaking a graduate program, unless the fields are completely dissimilar.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may only apply to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <p>Any applicant who was previously registered at Berkeley as a graduate student, no matter how briefly, must apply for readmission, not admission, even if the new application is to a different program.</p> <h4>Required documents for admissions applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts:  </strong><span style="font-size:1em">Upload unofficial transcripts with the application for the departmental initial review. Official transcripts of all college-level work will be required </span><strong style="font-size:1em">if admitted</strong><span style="font-size:1em">. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) you have attended. Request a current transcript from every post-secondary school that you have attended, including community colleges, summer sessions, and extension programs.</span> 	<div class="gmail_default">If you have attended Berkeley, upload unofficial transcript with the application for the departmental initial review. Official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em><strong>will not</strong></em> be required if admitted.</div> 	</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants can request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This requirement applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and most European countries. However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a U.S. university may submit an official transcript from the U.S. university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 1) courses in English as a Second Language, 2) courses conducted in a language other than English, 3) courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and 4) courses of a non-academic nature. If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests.</li> </ol>
<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Applicants to the program should have a bachelor's degree in science from a four-year college and at least one year of laboratory experience. Applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores, and are strongly encouraged to submit one GRE Subject Test score (in biochemistry and cell biology, chemistry, psychology, biology, computer science, or physics).</p>

<h3>Normative Time Requirements</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpFirst">Normative Time to Advancement</h4>
<h6 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle"><strong>Step I:</strong> Lab Rotations and Presentations</h6>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">During the first year of graduate study, each neuroscience graduate student spends three 10-week periods performing research projects in different faculty laboratories. The goal is to expose students to different techniques and approaches in neuroscience and to provide training in experimental design, critical analysis of data, and presentation of research findings. Performance in rotations is evaluated and graded. Rotations also allow students to identify the laboratory in which their thesis research will be performed. During the Spring semester, students formally present results from the laboratory rotations in a dedicated course, <span class="sc_courseinline">NEUROSC&#160;290</span> (Neuroscience First Year Research), designed to train students in clear, effective presentation of scientific findings.</p>

<h6 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle"><strong>Step II</strong></h6>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">All Neuroscience students take an Oral Qualifying Examination during the Spring semester of the second year. The exam is administered by four faculty members: three from within the Neuroscience Graduate Program, and a fourth from an outside department.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">During the exam, students demonstrate the ability to recognize fundamentally important research problems, propose relevant experimental approaches, and display comprehensive knowledge of appropriate disciplinary areas and related subjects. All students are required to pass the qualifying examination before advancing to doctoral candidacy.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Normative Time in Candidacy</h4>
<h6><strong>Step III</strong></h6>
<p>Students undertake research for the PhD dissertation under a four-person committee in charge of their research and dissertation. Students do original research using a wide variety of cutting-edge neuroscience methods. The students then write the dissertation based on the results of this research. On completion of the research and approval of the dissertation by the committee, the students are awarded the doctorate.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Total Normative Time</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Total Normative time is 5.5 years.</p>

</tbody></table>

<h3>Time in Candidacy</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpFirst">Dissertation Presentation/Finishing Talk</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">There is no formal defense of the completed dissertation. Neuroscience students are required to publicly present a Thesis Seminar about their dissertation research in their final year.</p>
<h3>Required Professional Development</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpFirst">Presentations</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">During their 4th year of study, students are required to make a presentation on the progress of their thesis work while enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline">NEUROSC&#160;294</span> (Neuroscience Graduate Student Presentation Seminar), a journal club, for a letter grade.</p>

<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Teaching</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Neuroscience students are required to serve as Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) for two semesters. Whenever possible, GSI assignments are determined with an eye toward student research interests. Teaching occurs during Fall semester of the second year and Spring semester of the third. Teaching affords students supervised experience in a variety of educational situations, including labs, discussion sections, and demonstrations. GSIs also participate in record-keeping, grading, advising, and student consultations.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">GSIs are evaluated by both supervising faculty and the students they teach. These evaluations become a permanent part of the student file. Deserving GSIs are nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award.</p>

Preparation and critiques of presentations will focus on organization of conceptual issues, data presentation, and summarization. 2) Exposure to current topics in neuroscience: faculty speakers will present on current issues and topics relevant to scientific</span><span class="deschide"> development in the neurosciences, such as technical methods, application of analytical and statistical techniques, and organization and preparation of competitive fellowship and other grant applications. 3) Seminar preparation: a crucial aspect of graduate education is the interaction of students with invited seminar speakers - who are often leaders in their fields. A selected number of class meetings will be devoted to the review of scientific articles published by upcoming seminar speakers and/or other related articles in the field.
