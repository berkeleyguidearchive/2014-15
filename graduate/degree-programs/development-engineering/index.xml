<p>The Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering (DE in Dev Eng) is an interdisciplinary training program for UC Berkeley doctoral students whose dissertation research includes topics related to the application of technology to address the needs of people living in poverty. Through coursework, research mentoring, and professional development, the program prepares students to develop, pilot, and evaluate technological interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex, low-resource settings. The DE in Dev Eng serves students across engineering disciplines, quantitative social science disciplines (including public health), business programs, information sciences, and natural sciences.</p>
<p>The program builds upon ongoing research in technological innovations, human-centered design, development economics, remote sensing and monitoring, data science, and impact analysis at UC Berkeley. The program is overseen by the Graduate Group in Development Engineering, administered through the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and affiliated with: </p>

</ul>

<p>This constellation of affiliates – through DIL - is a cornerstone partner in USAID’s <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab" target="_blank">Global Development Lab</a>
. As such, Dev Eng students are connected to an ecosystem of researchers and practitioners at Berkeley and also have access to a dynamic global network. To review the development engineering research projects sponsored by DIL, we encourage you to explore the <a href="http://dil.berkeley.edu/technology-portfolio/" target="_blank">DIL Technology Portfolio</a>

<![CDATA[
<p>To be admitted to the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering, an applicant must already be accepted into a PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley. Before applying for the DE, interested PhD students should arrange a consultation meeting with the Development Engineering Graduate Student Affairs Officer in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering as well as one of the Development Engineering Faculty Advisors. Students must apply at least one semester before their PhD qualifying examination. Admission to the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering is determined by the Development Engineering Faculty Advisors on a rolling basis throughout the academic year.</p>
<p>After the initial consultation meeting, a student must first submit an application in hard copy to the Development Engineering Graduate Student Affairs Officer in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and then confirm by email to the Development Engineering Faculty Advisor (who advised the student prior to student’s application), and to the Development Engineering Chair. The application must contain:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Petition for Admission to the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering</li>
	<li>Letter of intent summarizing research interests and educational or employment background in issues related to development economics or development engineering</li>
	<li>Letter of recommendation from a member of the Development Engineering faculty graduate group or the student’s graduate advisor</li>
	<li>Graduate Petition for Change of Major or Degree Goal (to indicate your interest in adding the Designated Emphasis)</li>
</ol>
<p>For further information regarding admission to graduate programs at UC Berkeley, please see the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/" target="_blank">Graduate Division's Admissions website</a>

<h3>Qualifying Examination</h3>
<p>All students must apply and be accepted to the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering <u>at least one semester before their qualifying examination</u>.  At least one faculty member of the Graduate Group in Development Engineering must participate in the qualifying examination committee, and will evaluate the exam from relevant perspectives. Satisfactory performance on the qualifying examination for the PhD will be judged according to the established rules in the student’s home department. If you are a student interested in development engineering research but none of your faculty advisors / committee members are in the Graduate Group in Development Engineering, consider encouraging one of them to apply for membership in the Graduate Group in Development Engineering. They should contact the Faculty Chair of the Development Engineering Graduate Group. </p>
<h3>Dissertation</h3>
<p>The dissertation must contain themes relevant to the field of Development Engineering (e.g. technology for economic and social development). The student’s Dissertation Committee must include at least one member of the Graduate Group in Development Engineering who can evaluate the dissertation from relevant perspectives. If you are a student interested in development engineering research but none of your faculty committee members are in the Graduate Group in Development Engineering, consider encouraging one of them to apply for membership in the Graduate Group in Development Engineering. They should contact the Faculty Chair of the Development Engineering Graduate Group. </p>
