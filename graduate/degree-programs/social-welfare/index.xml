<p>The School of Social Welfare is a graduate professional school dedicated to educating social workers and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles in the profession. Berkeley Social Welfare, with its MSW degree, was established in 1944 and since then we have prepared over 11,000 social work professionals for leadership positions in public and nonprofit human service sectors.</p>
<h3>Master of Social Welfare (MSW)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">A two-year, full-time program of study for the Master of Social Welfare (MSW) degree prepares students for advanced practice in social work. The MSW program is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Our multidisciplinary approach to curriculum and research allows us to educate social work practitioners, educators and researchers to think critically and change systems that perpetuate poverty and social disadvantage. Our mission is consistent with the public service mission of the University of California in its dedication to knowledge development and social improvement, specifically through educating professionals for careers in public and community service.</p>
<p class="Normal1">We achieve and advance our mission through classroom courses, supervised fieldwork and service learning opportunities, robust engaged public scholarship, and innovative research. Our students are trained and equipped with the knowledge of professional practices, policies, and programs required to address a wide range of contemporary societal problems. Classroom and field courses are designed to teach professionals to use tested knowledge, skill and research methods in their practice. Our high caliber faculty and graduate students use empirical evidence to inform practice and transform lives. Through our field education program, our 200 master’s students contribute over 130,000 hours of vital support to over 150 human service agencies and their low-income clients throughout the San Francisco Bay Area each year.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">The PhD in Social Welfare</h3>
<p class="Normal1">Berkeley Social Welfare's doctoral program develops scholars who challenge conventional wisdom and make significant contributions to the field of social welfare and the profession of social work through excellent research, teaching, policy development, and administration. Our doctoral graduates are prepared to tackle the most difficult social problems we face, contributing to new knowledge in areas as wide-ranging as poverty, severe mental health, racial and ethnic inequalities, and health. They form a cadre of researchers who are developing new ideas about service systems that can help children, families, and communities to develop and thrive.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Our faculty have been ranked as the most productive scholars in our field for over 25 years and serve as mentors for doctoral students. The School prefers applicants who hold a master's degree in social work or social welfare, or have comparable preparation in a closely related field and who show evidence of intellectual and other qualifications essential to successful doctoral study. Most Berkeley graduates become faculty members in schools of social work or social welfare, or hold leadership positions in policymaking agencies or research institutions.</p>

<h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Uniform minimum requirements for admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A minimum grade-point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g. Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, 230 on the computer-based test, 90 on the iBT test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Enough undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants who already hold a graduate degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees as evidence of broad research training, not as vocational training certificates; therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to take up new subject matter on a serious level without undertaking a graduate program, unless the fields are completely dissimilar.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may only apply to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <p>Any applicant who was previously registered at Berkeley as a graduate student, no matter how briefly, must apply for readmission, not admission, even if the new application is to a different program.</p> <h4>Required documents for admissions applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts:  </strong><span style="font-size:1em">Upload unofficial transcripts with the application for the departmental initial review. Official transcripts of all college-level work will be required </span><strong style="font-size:1em">if admitted</strong><span style="font-size:1em">. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) you have attended. Request a current transcript from every post-secondary school that you have attended, including community colleges, summer sessions, and extension programs.</span> 	<div class="gmail_default">If you have attended Berkeley, upload unofficial transcript with the application for the departmental initial review. Official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em><strong>will not</strong></em> be required if admitted.</div> 	</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants can request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This requirement applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and most European countries. However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a U.S. university may submit an official transcript from the U.S. university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 1) courses in English as a Second Language, 2) courses conducted in a language other than English, 3) courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and 4) courses of a non-academic nature. If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests.</li> </ol>
<h3>Admission to the PhD Program</h3>
<p>Applicants to the PhD program must complete an online application through the UC Berkeley Graduate Division Admission website. The application will become available in early September.</p>
<p>Among other application elements, all applicants must input the following:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Normative Time Requirements</h3>
<h4>Normative Time to Advancement</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Doctoral students in Social Welfare pursue knowledge in three fields of study, all related to their own interests:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">a social problem field;</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">a social science theory field; and</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">a field of social welfare intervention.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Students develop, in consultation with faculty, a program of course work and independent tutorials centering on the three fields of study selected for the qualifying examination and the research addressed in the dissertation.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Prior to taking the qualifying exam, students must complete the required coursework for Social Welfare PhDs; complete three research papers and field bibliographies, one for each field of study; and complete a dissertation prospectus. Typically, students are able to complete these tasks in three years, taking the Qualifying Exam in the spring semester of their third year. During that time, students are evaluated annually during the PhD Program Progress Review, which happens in the spring semester.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">There is no total unit requirement for the PhD degree, but doctoral students must enroll full-time until taking and passing the qualifying exam. A full-time program is 12 units each semester, no more than 4 of which may be earned by working as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) or a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI).</p>
<h4>Normative Time in Candidacy</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">PhD students may take the qualifying examination as soon as the spring semester of the second year, and are expected to take it no later than the spring semester of their third year. Once advanced to candidacy, doctoral students pursue a research agenda that will offer an original contribution to knowledge in the field. The dissertation is the final demonstration of scholarly, research, and professional abilities. Upon final signature of approval by the dissertation committee and submission to the Graduate Division, students are awarded the doctorate.</p>
<h4>Total Normative Time</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">In Social Welfare, it is expected that a doctoral student will complete the PhD degree within 10 semesters, having taken the qualifying exam by the end of the 3rd year and filed the dissertation by the end of the 5th year.</p>
<h3>Time to Advancement</h3>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p class="Normal1">Doctoral course work includes seminars in research methods, statistics, theory and other related courses within the School of Social Welfare and other departments of the university along with individual tutorials with members of the faculty. Doctoral students become proficient in research methodology and expert in their area of interest and ultimately demonstrate their scholarly competence in their dissertation.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The following <strong>required</strong> courses must be completed prior to the qualifying examination:</p>
<table class="sc_courselist" width="100%"><colgroup><col class="codecol" /><col class="titlecol" /><col align="char" char="." class="hourscol" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="even firstrow"><td class="codecol">PB&#160;HLTH&#160;142</td><td>Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Biology and Public Health</td><td class="hourscol">4</td></tr>

<h4>Field Papers</h4>
<h5 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Field Bibliographies</h5>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">For each of the three chosen fields of study, students prepare an extensive bibliography reflecting their knowledge of the literature of the field. Bibliographies are prepared in individual tutorials supervised by faculty members with expertise in their respective fields. The scope of the field bibliography is negotiated between the student and their faculty advisor. Each field covers a large area of knowledge, and while there is no recommended length, students and their advisors sometimes think of it as if they were preparing the bibliography for a college-level course in that area.</p>
<h5 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Research Papers</h5>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">While the bibliography represents a comprehensive view of a large field, the research papers focus in-depth on a narrow topic within that field. The research paper is developed in independent study with a faculty member. Research papers offer more than a descriptive review of the literature; they accurately describe selected themes, and reflect a critical and analytical approach to the topic. Students are encouraged and supported to produce papers which can easily be revised for publication.</p>
<h4>Prospectus</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">During the second and/or third year of study doctoral students prepare a prospectus of the research proposed for the doctoral dissertation while enrolled in a Dissertation Seminar. The prospectus describes the problem and objectives of the proposed research, the background of the problem and its significance to social welfare, related theory and research, and proposed methods of data collection and analysis. The faculty member who supervises its preparation serves on the student’s qualifying examination committee in addition to chairing the dissertation. The prospectus must be approved by the dissertation chair before scheduling the qualifying orals; a mandatory meeting with the dissertation committee follows one month after the qualifying examination.</p>
<h4>Qualifying Examination</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpFirst">The qualifying examination is a three-hour oral exam assessing mastery of the three chosen fields of study, and written materials submitted for the examination. It is conducted by a committee of five faculty members proposed by the student and approved by the Graduate Division. Considering both the written materials and performance in the oral examination, the committee  reports the results to the Graduate Division. When passed, this examination marks completion of required course work, mastery of three fields of study, and advancement to candidacy. Students advanced to candidacy are ready to proceed to the dissertation.</p>
<h3>Time in Candidacy</h3>
<h4>Dissertation</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpFirst">The dissertation topic and committee members are formalized at the time of application for advancement to candidacy,</p>
<h4>Dissertation Presentation/Finishing Talk</h4>
<p class="Normal1">No additional &quot;oral defense&quot; of the dissertation is required, although students are strongly encouraged to offer a brief oral presentation or poster of their dissertation findings at the annual Haviland Scholars Day held every spring in the School of Social Welfare.</p>

<h3>Unit requirements</h3>
<p class="Normal1">A minimum total of 48 units is required for the MSW degree, including at least 29 academic units of required and elective courses and 19 units of field education. Students will often exceed this with additional elective courses or special program options. Students typically enroll in 12-14 units per semester and complete the program in two years. A student may take up to 20.5 units in any semester. Students may also take elective courses during Berkeley Summer Sessions.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The Berkeley MSW Program is a two-year, full-time program. All students begin their program of study in a <strong>foundation</strong> <strong>curriculum</strong> in the first semester, and progress sequentially to and through an <strong>advanced curriculum</strong> designed to prepare them for specialized practice in one of five  specific areas of concentration:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Direct Practice in Child and Family Services</li>
	<li>Direct Practice in Community Mental Health</li>
	<li>Direct Practice in Gerontology Services</li>

<h3 class="Normal1">PhD Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1">The large majority of doctoral graduates from Social Welfare go on to secure tenure-track positions in Schools of Social Work/ Social Welfare across the country. Recent examples include graduates who are now conducting research and teaching at the University of Washington, the University of Denver, USC, the University of Tennessee, and Hunter College, to name a few. Others have gone on to secure post-doctoral positions at Stanford, UCSF, and Brown; and still others are working in private research firms conducting policy-relevant research.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">MSW Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1">Berkeley’s MSW curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to meet the standards of professional performance and success in the field of social work. A set of core competencies, representing the dimensions of social work practice that all social workers are expected to master during their professional training, is used to design and deliver both the foundation and advanced curricula. Each core competency is defined by a set of practice behaviors expected to result from achieving the competency, including advanced leadership practice behaviors across each concentration area. The competencies and associated practice behaviors are articulated in the Council on Social Work Education’s Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS), available online at this <a href="http://www.cswe.org/Accreditation.aspx" target="_blank">website.</a>

<p>Students are matched with faculty whose interests generally align either in terms of social problems, special populations, or social work interventions. Students work alongside their faculty mentor and other world renowned faculty on the Berkeley campus conducting research on a range of issues. Berkeley is located near other leading research institutions such as UCSF and Stanford that permit possible cross-institution learning and research opportunities. Many doctoral students in social welfare secure Graduate Student Researcher opportunities that allow them to learn the skills associated with the research enterprise. These are typically funded positions that help to develop student skills and talents while also contributing to a student’s financial aid package.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In order to prepare doctoral students for a career in teaching, students are offered ample opportunities to prepare for teaching and to practice their developing skills. Students are encouraged to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline">SOC&#160;WEL&#160;375 Teaching in Social Welfare</span>, where they are exposed to core concepts relating to teaching in the field of social work and social welfare. Thereafter, students may serve as a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) under the guidance of a faculty member in the School of Social Welfare. Students advanced to candidacy may be considered to serve as instructors for a course during Berkeley summer sessions.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">PhD Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1">Students engaged in doctoral studies at Berkeley have ample opportunities to engage in a range of professional development activities. Students are assisted by faculty members and their doctoral student colleagues as they prepare for leadership roles with competence, thoughtfulness, and humility. The School hosts a regular brown-bag lunch series for doctoral students to present their developing or completed research with colleagues and faculty in an informal atmosphere. Students may also take advantage of the numerous opportunities to affiliate with leading professional and disciplinary units on campus as well as specialized research centers. For example, a number of our students have worked closely with the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues and the Center for Research on Social Change. Students are also encouraged to work with their faculty mentor to develop abstracts for submission to national and international conferences. Students whose papers are accepted for presentation are offered funding to support travel to conferences. Doctoral students are also supported in their application for research funding, fellowship support, and other applications as appropriate</p>
<p class="Normal1">Students are expected to engage in the craft of publishing either in collaboration with their faculty mentor, other faculty, with doctoral colleagues, or alone. Students receive direct guidance and support in these endeavors from their faculty mentor. Students are also provided career guidance and support throughout the faculty recruitment process, including support for preparing applications, preparing for interviews, conducting mock interviews and presentations, and other recruitment activities.</p>
<h3 class="Normal1">MSW Program</h3>
<p class="Normal1">Parallel to preparing professionals with the tools needed for a wide range of social work careers and educating doctoral students for careers in teaching, research and policy analysis, Career and Professional Development at Berkeley Social Welfare aims to assist students and alumni in gaining the skills that are essential to fulfilling their professional development and career management needs. The Career and Professional Development Office, staffed by a full-time Career Services Specialist, facilitates career services activities that prepare our students for the job search, interviewing, professional presentations, and engaging in leadership. We provide our students with opportunities to connect with alumni and employers to network and gain further profession-specific knowledge. Through our online Career Services Management system, we provide students and alumni with access to services including searching for and applying to social welfare/human services related jobs, viewing and reserving events, participating in a professional mentorship network, and creating a résumé.</p>
