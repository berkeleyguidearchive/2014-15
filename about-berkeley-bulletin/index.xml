<h1>The Berkeley Academic Guide, 2014-15 Bulletin</h1>
<p>The Berkeley Academic Guide is a new incarnation of the campus general catalog, last published in 2011. When the Office of the Registrar took over production of the campus catalog we decided to ask campus stakeholders about what they would like a campus catalog to do and be. Ideas and input from students, faculty, academic staff and advisers defined the scope and objectives of our project as we set out to build a better catalog and 18 months later, the Berkeley Academic Guide was launched.  </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1922fcf1-f3ec-6443-7dae-5b07a351e3a0">The goals of the Berkeley Academic Guide are to improve access, support advising and provide accuracy. We hope you can see improvements in these areas already. </span>The site is still evolving and our implementation will continue throughout the summer. There are still new features on the way and training and documentation are also being developed.</p>
<p>We hope you like what you see so far.  We are always interested in your feedback and ideas. Just drop us a note at <a href="mailto:guide@berkeley.edu">guide@berkeley.edu</a>
<a href="mailto:berkeleybulletin@list.berkeley.edu"> </a>
or you may contact Associate Registrar Johanna Metzgar directly at 415-254-6033.</p>

<h1>Special Thanks</h1>
<p>We would like to especially thank Christopher Keith, associate director, Integration and Identity Services at Brown University. Chris is the creator of <a href="http://www.brown.edu/academics/college/concentrations/" target="_blank">Focal Point</a>
,  an innovative tool located on the Brown University website that presents prospective concentrations to undergraduate students and which was the inspiration for our program landing pages.   </p>
