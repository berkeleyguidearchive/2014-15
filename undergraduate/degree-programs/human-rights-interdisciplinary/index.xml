<h3>Minor</h3>
<p>Human rights have become the moral language of today, the idiom in which we discuss our common humanity and weigh competing claims for resources, rights and protections. The Human Rights Interdisciplinary (HRI) Minor at UC Berkeley allows students to shape their education around coursework which investigates the legal, political, historical, economic, social, psychological, and representational dynamics of human rights.</p>
<p><span>Helping undergraduates explore issues via multiple forms of thought and media of expression - through literature as well as politics, journalism as well as law, film as well as anthropology – the HRI minor emphasizes the many different intellectual spaces in which human rights questions are currently being posed.</span></p>
<p><span>UC Berkeley is already a fertile ground for human rights study and work. The campus houses the Human Rights Center, which conducts human rights investigations and promotes research around the globe, The 2048 Project, an interactive website created by faculty at Boalt Hall School of Law allows students to learn about and participate in the evolution of human rights, and The War Crimes Studies Center monitors war crimes worldwide. Berkeley students undertake human rights related internships through a number of campus programs, including CITRUS (Information Technology Research in the Interests of Society), Peace and Conflict Studies, and the Global Poverty Minor, to name just a few.</span></p>
<p><span>Dozens of individual faculty members do research into human rights issues, and over one hundred courses across campus are offered each semester which directly treat human rights, while dozens more are indirectly related.</span></p>
<p><span>The Human Rights Minor offers a teaching program specifically focused on human rights but open to myriad disciplinary approaches and welcoming students from many corners of campus. In so doing, it encourages students to recognize how human rights are intertwined with fields as disparate as post-colonial literature and medical ethics, as well as with the more familiar fields of politics and international law.</span></p>
<h3><span>Declaring the Minor</span></h3>
<p>The first step in declaring the HRI Minor is to fill out an <a href="http://hri.ugis.berkeley.edu/content/hri-forms" target="_blank">Intent to Declare HRI Minor form</a>
 and to meet with an HRI Minor faculty adviser to get the form approved.</p>

<p><span>The Department encourages students to meet with an HRI Minor faculty adviser early in their academic careers. Advisors will help craft a plan of study, approve elective courses, and help students connect with the faculty members whose work best fits their academic interests.</span></p>

The course will provide the students with an opportunity to place emerging transnational rights institutions into a historical and geopolitical framework.

</p>
<div class="coursebody">

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">The focus of this course will be on the various ways the nature and trajectory of modern capitalism has been interpreted. Our stress will be on post-Marxist works of analysis. The initial focal point will be on the work of Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter, as well as important current debates in economic history and social theory generated by their work. Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx. The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about</span><span class="deschide"> the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system. We will also consider a number of current efforts that look at the systemic nature of capitalism. In particular, we are interested in how economic historians now see the development of capitalism. We also want to examine the Weberian tradition in terms of the role of culture in shaping economic behavior. Debates about the nature of globalization will also be considered as well as analysis of the changing nature of work.

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">In this course, we will trace some of the substantive changes and transformations taking place in contemporary Europe in the areas of culture, society, and politics. In particular, we will look at the effects of massive migration flows--due to globalization processes--on the national culture of the core countries and examine the ways in which particular national cultures react to the increasing multiculturization of Europe. The goal of the course is, first of all, to familiarize students with a</span><span class="deschide"> variety of cultural, social, and political innovations that accompany the formation of multicultural Europe. This involves (1) an examination of the traditional concepts of nationhood and citizenship, and (2)a study of the Europeanization of culture.

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow overflow">This class is an introduction to research methods, leading students through different units built around specific learning goals and practical exercises. The course is designed to teach a range of research skills, including the ability to formulate research questions and to engage in scholarly conversations and arguments; the identification, evaluation, mobilization, and interpretation of sources; methods and instruments of field research (interviews, questionnaires, and sampling) and statistical</span><span class="deschide"> thinking; and the construction of viable arguments and explanation in the human sciences. At the same time, the course is designed to help students identify their own thesis topic, bibliography, and methodological orientation.
