<h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses for pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>
.</p>

<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

<![CDATA[
 <p>Students in the College of Engineering must complete 120 semester units with the following provisions: </p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">1.        Completion of the requirements of one Engineering<a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/guide/departments" target="_blank"> major program </a> of study. </p>  <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">2.        A minimum overall grade point average of 2.000 (C average) and a minimum 2.000 grade point average in upper division technical course work required of the major. </p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">3.        The final 30 units must be completed in residence in the College of Engineering on the Berkeley campus in two consecutive semesters. </p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">4.        All technical courses (math, science &amp; engineering), required of the major or not, must be taken on a letter graded basis (unless they are only offered P/NP). </p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">5.        Entering freshman are allowed a maximum of eight semesters to complete their degree requirements.  Entering junior transfers are allowed a maximum of four semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters. </p> <p><strong>Humanities and Social Science Requirement</strong><br/> To promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement is built into all the Engineering programs of study. The requirement includes two approved reading and composition courses and four additional approved courses, within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. </p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">1.        Complete a minimum of six courses (3 units or more) from the approved <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq" target="_blank">Humanities/Social Sciences (H/SS) lists</a> . </p>  <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">2.        Two of the six courses must fulfill the<a href="/2014-15/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank"> </a> Reading and Composition Requirement. These courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and MUST be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year. For detailed lists of courses that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements, please see the <a href="/2014-15/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition page</a>  in this bulletin. </p>  <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">3.        The four additional courses must be chosen from the H/SS comprehensive list. These courses may be taken on a Pass/Not Passed Basis (P/NP).</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">4.        At least two of the six courses must be upper division (courses numbered 100-196).</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">5.        At least two courses must be from the same department and at least one of the two must be upper division. This is called the *Series requirement. AP tests can be combined with a course to complete the series requirement. For example, AP History (any) combined with an upper division History course would satisfy the series requirement</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">6.        One of the six courses must satisfy the campus American Cultures Requirement. For detailed lists of courses that fulfill American Cultures requirements, please see the <a href="/2014-15/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures page </a> in this bulletin. </p>  <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">7.        A maximum of two exams (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level) may be used toward completion of the H/SS requirement. <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/exams" target="_blank">Visit this link</a> </p>  <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">8.        No courses offered by an Engineering department (IEOR, CE, etc.) other than BIOE 100, CS C79, ENGIN 125, ENGIN 130AC, 157AC, ME 191K and ME 191AC may be used to complete H/SS requirements.</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">9.        Courses may fulfill multiple categories. For example, if you complete City and Regional Planning 115 and 118AC that would satisfy the series requirement, the two upper division courses requirement and the American Cultures Requirement.</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">10.     The College of Engineering (COE) uses modified versions of five of the College of Letters and Science (L&amp;S) breadth requirements lists to provide options to our students for completing the Humanities and Social Science requirement. Our requirement is different than that of L &amp; S, so the guidelines posted on the top of each L &amp; S breadth list do NOT apply to COE students.</p> <p style="margin-left:22.5pt">11.     Foreign language courses MAY be used to complete H/SS requirements. L &amp; S does not allow students to use many language courses, so their lists will not include all options open to Engineering students. For a list of language options, visit <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/FL" target="_blank">http://coe.berkeley.edu/FL</a> </p>  <p>*NOTE: for the Series Requirement: The purpose of the series requirement is to provide depth of knowledge in a certain area. Therefore, a two-course sequence not in the same department may be approved by petition, in cases in which there is a clear and logical connection between the courses involved. </p>
