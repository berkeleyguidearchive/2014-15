<h3>Bachelor of Arts</h3>
<p>Since 1981, the interdisciplinary major in Middle Eastern Studies (MES) has provided UC Berkeley students with the opportunity to study a region of great historical and cultural importance whose political, economic, and social development is closely linked to that of our own society. The MES major covers the Arab world, Turkey, Iran, and Israel, intertwining history and culture, geography and ecology, politics and economics, with an emphasis on the modern and contemporary Middle East. Its broad and balanced program of study draws on a wide variety of Middle East-related courses offered by faculty from more than 20 different departments and schools in the University. Students in the MES major also learn at least one of the major Middle Eastern languages of today: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish. MES graduates have gone on to work in industry and government, both in the United States and abroad. About half pursue graduate studies. Many then go on to academic or professional careers.</p>
<p>The MES major falls under the academic supervision of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES). The CMES organizes public lectures, publishes a newsletter, maintains a small library, and promotes scholarship on the Middle East at all levels. Students are encouraged to utilize the Center's many resources. The MES major is administered through the International and Area Studies (IAS) Office. The IAS office provides information on all administrative aspects of the major including advice on when and how to declare, fulfilling requirements, and timely program completion. Academic advising, including planning a course of study to suit individual needs and interests, identifying a thesis topic and adviser, and career counseling, is offered by the MES Chair and Co-Chair.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Declaring a major in MES follows guidelines established by the College of Letters and Science. Students wishing to declare Middle Eastern Studies must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Completed or be currently enrolled in one course that meets the MES lower division requirement (<span class="sc_courseinline">NE&#160;STUD&#160;10</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">HISTORY&#160;12</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">M&#160;E&#160;STU&#160;10</span>) at UC Berkeley or have completed an equivalent course at another institution. Other courses (listed as having 50% or more Middle East-related content) may be substituted with Chair or Co-Chair approval for the purposes of declaring the major only. The lower division requirement must still be met to declare the major, however, and should be taken no later than the following semester.</li>

	<li>Completed or be currently enrolled in a modern Middle Eastern language course (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish)</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher</li>
	<li>Have attended a major declaration workshop</li>
	<li>Must not be in their final semester of undergraduate work</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications are available in the IAS office at 101 Stephens Hall. They must be signed by the MES coordinating faculty adviser and returned to the IAS office.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senior students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.6 in courses for the major and 3.5 in all coursework completed at UC Berkeley are eligible to apply to pursue honors during their final semester. Honors students enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline">M&#160;E&#160;STU&#160;H195</span> instead of <span class="sc_courseinline">M&#160;E&#160;STU&#160;190</span>. Entry into <span class="sc_courseinline">M&#160;E&#160;STU&#160;H195</span> is determined by GPA, the quality of the thesis prospectus produced in MES 102, and the recommendation of the MES Co-Chairs and instructor of MES 102.</span>
</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>The minor in Middle Eastern Studies is designed to give students an introduction to the study of the modern Middle East (the Arab, Turkish, Persian, and Israeli nation-states) through social science and humanities courses. (Students interested in emphasizing language, archaeology and/or ancient civilizations should investigate minors in the Department of Near Eastern Studies.) The MES minor is open to all undergraduates except MES majors.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>All Middle Eastern Studies (MES) students must be able to demonstrate proficiency equivalent to four college-level semesters in a modern Middle Eastern language: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish. The first semester language course must be completed or be in progress at the time of admission to the major. The remaining three courses may be completed at any time before graduation. The language cannot be started in the senior year and finished in the post-graduation summer.</p>
<p>There are three ways students can fulfill the four-semester language requirement, depending on their background and ability:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Through coursework:</strong> A combination of college, summer program, or college-level study abroad programs could satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester of a language with a grade of C- or better. The first, second, and third level of language may be taken on a Pass<em>/No Pass</em> basis. However, the fourth semester <em>must</em> be taken for a letter grade. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university are acceptable. Advanced Placement Language Test scores of 5 complete the requirement. However, transcripts and score reports must be provided. See the MES coordinating faculty adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>With a proficiency examination:</strong> Students whose language skills are at a fourth semester or beyond and who do not wish to take language courses can opt to test out of the requirement by requesting a language exam at the time of admission by an appropriate language instructor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (see language directions in the Department of Near Eastern Studies for certification requirements). Language Certification forms are required and may be obtained through the IAS office. Students whose exams reveal only partial ability to read, write and converse must take additional language courses to elevate their level as determined by the examiner. These courses may be in any of the four Middle Eastern languages. Students who are able to show advanced or native ability in one Middle Eastern language are encouraged, but not required, to begin study of a second Middle Eastern language.</li>
	<li><strong>Being a non-native English speaker:</strong> Non-native speakers of English may use their native language to satisfy this requirement. However, documentation of fourth semester ability is still required. Students may take a proficiency test (see above) or provide documentation that they have been educated in their native language at least through high school.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Information: Concentration Requirement</h3>
<p>Four courses are selected to form a disciplinary concentration, requiring students to pursue advanced study of a selected topic in Middle Eastern Studies following a particular disciplinary approach. In order to ensure disciplinary depth, at least two of the four courses taken to fulfill the concentration requirement must be from the same department. The remaining two courses must be thematically related to the selected topic. The concentration must be designed in consultation with the MES Chair or co-Chair and pre-approved by an MES staff advisor in the IAS office. Students may choose their concentration courses from the list of Core Courses and from any courses listed as having at least 50% Middle East-related content. Students may also petition to count up to two courses listed as having 33% Middle East-related content toward their concentration.</p>
