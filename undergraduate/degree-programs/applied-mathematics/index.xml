<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Mathematics offers undergraduate major programs in mathematics and applied mathematics leading to the BA degree. These programs provide excellent preparation for advanced degrees in math, physical sciences, economics, and industrial engineering, as well as graduate study in business, education, law, and medicine. They also prepare students for post-baccalaureate positions in business, technology, industry, teaching, government, and finance.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>You are eligible to declare the major in Applied Mathematics if you have met ALL of the following criteria: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Completion of <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;1A Calculus</span> &amp; <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;1B Calculus</span> (or equivalent) with averages grades of at least &quot;C&quot;. For our policy on Advanced Placement scores, please click <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/courses/choosing/ap-exams" target="_blank">here</a>
.</li>

	<li>Completion of <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;53 Multivariable Calculus</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;54 Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;55 Discrete Mathematics</span> (or equivalent) with minimum grades of &quot;C&quot; in each, or completion of two of those three courses (with minimum grades of &quot;C&quot; in each) and currently enrolled in the third.  If declaring while currently enrolled in the final lower-division requirement, that course will need to be completed with a letter grade of at least &quot;C&quot;. <em>Please note that we will accept Computer Science 70 in lieu of <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;55 Discrete Mathematics</span> if you have a double-major in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</em>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>Mathematics is the language of science. In Galileo’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is impossible to understand a single word of it. Without those, one is wandering in a dark labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathematics majors learn the internal workings of this language, its central concepts and their interconnections. These involve structures going far beyond the geometric figures to which Galileo refers. Majors also learn to use mathematical concepts to formulate, analyze, and solve real-world problems. Their training in rigorous thought and creative problem-solving is valuable not just in science, but in all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>By the time of graduation, majors should have acquired the following knowledge and skills:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Analytical skills
	<ul>
		<li>An understanding of the basic rules of logic</li>
		<li>The ability to distinguish a coherent argument from a fallacious one, both in mathematical reasoning and in everyday life</li>
		<li>An understanding of the role of axioms or assumptions</li>
		<li>The ability to abstract general principles from examples</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Problem-solving and modeling skills (important for all, but especially for majors in Applied Mathematics)
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to recognize which real-world problems are subject to mathematical reasoning</li>
		<li>The ability to make vague ideas precise by representing them in mathematical notation, when appropriate</li>
		<li>Techniques for solving problems expressed in mathematical notation</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Communication skills
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to formulate a mathematical statement precisely</li>
		<li>The ability to write a coherent proof</li>
		<li>The ability to present a mathematical argument verbally</li>
		<li>Majors in Mathematics with a Teaching Concentration should acquire familiarity with techniques for explaining K-12 mathematics in an accessible and mathematically correct manner.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Reading and research skills
	<ul>
		<li>Sufficient experience in mathematical language and foundational material to be well-prepared to extend one’s mathematical knowledge further through independent reading</li>
		<li>Exposure to and successful experience in solving mathematical problems presenting substantial intellectual challenge</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<![CDATA[
<p>The Undergraduate Adviser provides information on requirements, policies, procedures, resources, opportunities, untying bureaucratic knots, developing study plans, attending commencement, certifying degrees and minors. The student is strongly encouraged to see the Undergraduate Adviser as soon as problems arise.</p>
<p>The individually assigned Faculty Adviser counsels students on the academic content of their mathematics major. The Faculty Adviser's signature is required on program forms (a) when a student first declares the major; and (b) confirming approval of courses that are not already pre-approved to be used for the major electives. Appropriate questions for the faculty adviser include selection of electives and preparation for graduate-level courses in a specific mathematical area to be used for Honors in the major. Be sure and let him/her know if you are considering graduate work in or related to mathematics, and solicit help in how best to prepare.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the student's adviser goes on sabbatical or is taken off the major advising list and a new official adviser will be appointed by the Head Major Adviser. Requests to change advisers will be accommodated to the extent possible on an individual basis. Please make requests well in advance of the Tele-BEARS period in which the change is to become effective.</p>
<h3>Tele-BEARS and Adviser Codes</h3>
<p>Adviser Codes are required for enrollment in the next semester's courses during Tele-BEARS. Mathematics majors must consult with their Faculty Adviser when they first declare. In subsequent semesters, they may meet with the Staff Advisers. Meeting the Faculty or Staff Advisers should take place prior to the beginning of the Tele-BEARS period to ensure obtaining the Adviser Code in a timely manner. Before meeting with the Adviser, the student should plan a tentative program for the coming semester, and have an overall plan for completing the major. Tele-BEARS packets consisting of a Course Approval Form (green) and a Major Checklist (white) which shows your completed courses and grades will be available in the Main Office (970 Evans) two weeks prior to the start of Tele-BEARS. Faculty Advisers hold regular office hours during the academic year. These hours are posted on the bulletin board across from 965 Evans. It is best to allow time for more than one meeting in case decisions depend on information not available at the first visit.</p>
<p>When the Adviser and the student have agreed on a program of study, the Adviser will sign the Course Approval Form (green). Approved alternatives and electives should be indicated on the bottom of the program form and initialed by the Adviser. Adviser Codes are released by the Staff Advisers in 964 and 965 Evans Hall. Adviser Codes are not given over the phone.</p>
<p>Admitted transfer students should attend CalSO orientation programs during the semester preceding their first semester at Cal. Returning students should see their faculty adviser or the Undergraduate Adviser during the semester prior to their readmitted term.</p>
<p>Although students are formally required to see their Faculty Advisers only when they first declare the major, they are strongly encouraged to consult with them, or seek the advice of any faculty member, at any time. If the Adviser's office hours conflict with the student's classes, the student should schedule an appointment with via email.</p>
