<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Media Studies program is an undergraduate interdisciplinary group major in the <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/about-college/l-s-divisions/undergraduate-division/ugis" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies</a>
. Our faculty come from a variety of disciplines, bringing the perspectives and methods of their fields to bear on the analysis of the mass media. Our emphasis in this major is analytical and historical; we are largely concerned with developing in students the ability to assess the roles and impact of the major mass media on American life, rather than with developing specific media production skills.</p>

The class will give a context to those changes and provide an overview of comtemporary journalistic institutions. Students will examine how news is made, who decides what news is, who makes it, who profits by it, and what rules guide how reporters and editors work. Central issues affecting journalism, such as bias and professionalism, will be discussed. The class is</span><span class="deschide"> not specifically intended for future journalists, but students will learn why pursuing a career in journalism can be so fulfilling and thrilling, as well as becoming better consumers of the news.

The class will examine the role of journalists in</span><span class="deschide"> the rise of the Cold War more than half a century ago. It will also examine the importance of media barons, by studying two highly readable biographies, one of William Randolph Hearst, the other of Katherine Graham.
