<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Faculty Group in Asian Studies administers an interdisciplinary program leading to BA, MA, and PhD degrees. Utilizing the faculty and facilities of the entire university, these degree programs cut across conventional disciplinary lines and emphasize a basic core of knowledge concerning one particular geographic area of Asia. Within this core, which requires course work in multiple departments and reading knowledge of at least one Asian language, regionally-oriented students have the freedom to plan an individual program according to their particular interests and approaches. No two programs are alike, and students work closely with the Student Affairs office and with a faculty mentor in designing their customized academic plan. The Group also offers concurrent degree programs with the Schools of Journalism and Law, and an undergraduate minor. The Group is supported in its efforts by the <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Institute of East Asian Studies</a>
, the <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">International and Area Studies Teaching Program</a>
 and the <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/?q=about-college/l-s-divisions/undergraduate-division/ugis" target="_blank">Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies of the College of Letters and Science.</a>
</p>

<p>UC Berkeley has long been noted for its outstanding scholarship in the area of Asian Studies. A Faculty Group and an interdisciplinary graduate program on Asia was first established in 1949 under the name Asiatic Studies. The name was changed to Asian Studies in 1959. An interdisciplinary undergraduate major in Asian Studies was established in 1975. More than seventy faculty members and fifteen departments are presently engaged in teaching and research concerning Asia. These resources are supplemented by extensive library facilities and by the programs of five major area centers that offer lecture series and colloquia throughout the year. The Bay Area itself, with its Asian ethnic communities, museums, performing arts, monasteries, and trade centers provides unlimited cultural opportunities for the student interested in reaching beyond the confines of the university.</p>
