<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Bioengineering applies engineering principles and practices to living things, to solve some of the most challenging problems that face our world today. In Bioengineering, also known as Biomedical Engineering, our work is concentrated on high-impact applications instrumentation, molecular and cellular engineering, and computational biosciences that will bring about major advances in medicine and the life sciences.</p>
<p>Founded in 1998, the department is supported by exceptional faculty, strong ties to other departments on campus, and close collaborations with other institutions such as UC San Francisco and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We continue to expand our department with new faculty, staff, facilities, and research programs.</p>

<div class="coursebody">

<p class="courseblockdesc"><span class="descshow">This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biotechnology.
</span><br />
</p>
<div id="342" class="coursedetails" aria-expanded="false">
<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives & Outcomes</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br />The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br />This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.
</p><p class=""><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
• Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
• Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
<br/>
• Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/>
• Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
• Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>

Students will develop and demonstrate this skill at synthesis through the capstone project.
</p><p class=""><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Projects will provide practical instruction and experience in solving real problems in translational medicine, and it is anticipated that some will lead to innovations with commercial potential. This experience, undertaken by each student as a member of a team and marked by extensive interaction with faculty, peers, and industry partners, enables the student to integrate the leadership and technical dimensions of the professional MTM curriculum.
