<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Military Affairs Program, within the Division of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS), comprises the three distinct military officers' commissioning programs: Air Force Reserved Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), Army ROTC, and Naval ROTC. The purpose of the program is to integrate the educational offerings of the separate military services into the regular University curricula. In performing academic functions, the Military Affairs Unit operates the same as any other program within UGIS. Its military faculty members, though nominated by the three military services, are subject to the same selection process as other UC Berkeley faculty members, and the Academic Senate's Committee on Courses must approve its curriculum. Military Affairs courses are open to all Berkeley students, as well as to students from other East Bay colleges under cross-enrollment agreements or through UC Berkeley Extension.</p>




<p>No undergraduate majors or minors or graduate degrees are offered in any of the following programs; they are designed to supplement a student's degree program.</p>




<a name="aerospacestudiesairforcerotc"></a>
<h3>Aerospace Studies (Air Force ROTC)</h3>




<p>The Department of Aerospace Studies offers students in virtually all academic areas the opportunity to qualify for a commission as a 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant in the United States Air Force while simultaneously completing university degree requirements. Each eligible student must have at least three full academic years remaining in his/her bachelor's degree program; under certain circumstances, an Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) cadet may finish the AFROTC program while simultaneously completing one year of a graduate degree program.</p>




<p>Students interested in AFROTC are eligible to compete for scholarships which cover the costs of tuition, books, and most fees.  In addition, a $250-$400 monthly living allowance is paid to each student on scholarship. Cadets competing for scholarships should contact the Recruiting Flight Commander at (510) 642-3572.</p>




<p>The AFROTC Detachment at Berkeley emphasizes student participation and involvement.  Classes are conducted as seminars and call for active student discussion.  In addition, there is a weekly two-hour leadership laboratory that is mandatory for all AFROTC cadets.  In this laboratory, students become involved in the management of their own cadet organization. Cadets also participate in volunteer projects, visits to Air Force bases, and various community outreach programs.</p>




<p>Completion of the program to earn a commission as an Air Force 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant requires enrollment during each semester in a specified course in Aerospace Studies or Military Affairs.  The normal sequence for the four-year program is as follows: freshman, Aerospace Studies 1A (fall) and Aerospace Studies 1B (spring); sophomores, Aerospace Studies 2A (fall) and Aerospace Studies 2B (spring); juniors, Aerospace Studies 135A (fall) and Aerospace Studies 135B (spring); seniors, Military Affairs 145A (fall) and Military Affairs 145B (spring). The freshman and sophomore courses are each one credit hour, and the junior and senior courses are both three credits each.</p>




<p>Aerospace Studies courses are open to all University students; students from other institutions may participate in the AFROTC program through cross-enrollment arrangements or through the University Extension.</p>




<p>For further information on enrollment requirements and procedures, contact the Recruiting Flight Commander at (510) 642-3572, afrotc@military.berkeley.edu, and check out the AFROTC Detachment 85 <a href="http://airforcerotc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">website</a>

<h3>Military Science (Army ROTC)</h3>




<p>The Army Officer Education Program offers a variety of credit courses focused on the study of the military as an institution, adventure training opportunities, and a program of laboratory work in practical military skills. The program provides an opportunity to examine service in the Army while earning a baccalaureate degree. A student who completes the program may earn a commission in the Regular Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard.</p>




<p>Graduate or undergraduate students can complete the Military Science requirements through a four-year, three-year, or two-year program. The four-year and three-year programs involve the basic and advanced courses; the two-year program involves only the advanced course. The Army Reserve Officers' Training Course (ROTC) Basic Course consists of two distinct components, the classroom introduction to the army profession and officership of the Military Science and Leadership (MSL) I year, and the experiential examination of leadership, decision-making, and group process of the MSL-II year. Both Basic Course years are designed to enhance student interest in ROTC and the Army. MSL-I lessons provide an overview of the key subjects of pre-commissioning, which will be treated in much greater depth in the Advanced Course. The MSL-II year places cadets in a wide variety of group exercises designed to emphasize various professional leadership competencies and insights. These events are held both inside the classroom and in the outdoor settings. The instructor, acting as facilitator, helps guide student processing, or after-action reviews, of the events to derive the leadership, group dynamics, and problem-solving lessons that the exercises offer. In addition to military skills, practical &quot;life skills&quot; are emphasized throughout the two years. By the end of the Basic Course, cadets should possess a basic understanding of the unique aspects of the officer corps, individual fitness, and healthy lifestyle. The lessons are designed to maximize cadet participation, inspire intellectual curiosity, and stimulate self-study. Upon completion of the course, cadets are eligible to enter the advanced course.</p>




<p>The Army ROTC Advanced Course is composed of four advanced courses, Military Science (MS) 131, 132, 141, and 142, and the Leadership Development and Assessment Course (LDAC). The Advanced Course is designed to teach all knowledge, skills, and attitudes for commissioning as a new second lieutenant, and to establish a sound foundation for a career as a commissioned Army officer. The content and methods of the Advanced Course assume no prior cadet experience or other military training. This approach is taken because the Advanced Course comprises the minimum curriculum that an individual must complete in order to be commissioned. Advanced Course lessons are carefully sequenced and linked and are progressive in their treatment of key officer knowledge and competencies. Students are encouraged to synthesize lessons to form broader perspectives, deeper insights, and more robust problem-solving abilities by the use of earlier lessons. The sequencing of lessons is also designed to meet the immediate needs of cadets by addressing topics needed for success in the performance of cadet responsibilities early in the MS 131 term and at the LDAC. Topics are designed to facilitate entry into active military service during the MS 142 term.</p>




<p>The two-year program begins with direct placement in the advanced course. It is available to undergraduate or graduate students, who have completed any of the following: enlisted military service; the Army's Leadership Training Course (LTC), which is a four-week ROTC basic camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky; or three years of Junior ROTC. Students must also be academic juniors or higher with at least two academic years left until completion of their degree when they enter the advanced course.</p>

<h3>Naval Science (Naval ROTC)</h3>




<p>The Department of Naval Science offers several programs of instruction for men and women leading to commissions in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps. Naval Science courses are open to all university students or may be taken through UC Berkeley Extension.</p>




<p>Students enrolled in one of the four-year Naval ROTC programs will normally complete the following courses during their first two years as part of their overall academic load: NS 1, 2, 3, and 10.</p>




<p>Navy Option students enrolled in either the four-year or two-year program will normally complete the following courses during their junior and senior years: NS 12A, 12B, 401 and 412. Marine Option students will participate in a Marine seminar and complete the History of Littoral Warfare (MA 154) and Evolution of Warfare (MA 20). All Navy Option scholarship students must complete one year of calculus and one year of calculus-based physics by the end of their sophomore and junior years respectively.</p>




<p>Students are also required to attend weekly professional development laboratories. These three-hour sessions offer the student midshipman an active role in the management and direction of the midshipman battalion and provide time for the midshipmen to explore professional topics. Student midshipmen participate in four-to-six week summer training cruises throughout the world. At sea they apply theoretical aspects of their education and training to the real world environment of a Navy ship. Marine Option midshipmen attend Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in the summer between their junior and senior year.</p>




<p>Currently, there are five programs available:</p>




<ol>
	<li><strong>Naval Reserved Officers' Training Corps (NROTC) Five-Year Scholarship Program:</strong> Nationwide competition is open to physically qualified men and women between the ages of 17 and 21 with waivers available for prior active duty to maximum commissioning year age of 29.
